## Description

This project is an implementation of a Galton Board using Matter.js, a 2D physics engine in JavaScript. The Galton Board is a vertical board with pegs arranged in a triangular pattern, where balls are dropped from the top and bounce off the pegs as they fall into different sections at the bottom. The goal of this project is to create an interactive and educational simulation of a Galton Board that includes a counter for each section to keep track of the number of balls that fall into each section. This project can be used for educational purposes to demonstrate concepts of probability, randomness, and physics in a visually engaging way. Users can observe the distribution of balls in different sections and see how it relates to probability and randomness. The counters for each section provide a quantitative measure of the outcomes, allowing users to experiment and learn about the principles behind the Galton Board.

## Technologies & Libraries Used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Matter.js

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
App is ready to be deployed!

## React App Install Package

### `npm install matter-js`

Matter. js is a 2D rigid body physics engine written in JavaScript. This library can help you easily simulate 2D physics in the browser. It offers a lot of features like the ability to create rigid bodies and assign physical properties like mass, area or density to them.\
